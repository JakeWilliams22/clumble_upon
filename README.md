Stumble Upon clone & utilities after closure of the site in June 2018.

Clumble Upon (clone + stumble-upon) creates a vastly simplified version of the old UI of stumbleupon, as a result of the site rebranding and rebrand/redesign as Mix.com in June 2018.

In June 2018, StumbleUpon underwent a redesign and rebrand to become Mix.com. Many users' favorite feature for the site was the automatic, extremely varied articles that were automatically loaded - often leading to articles/resources/games users would not usually be interested in but ended up finding enjoyable or interesting. Instead of this page to page traversal system, Mix displays all articles at once. Having all of the matches available to see means that users' own biases go into what articles they read. This clone replicates the old behavior of stumbleupon in showing users articles related to their interest without the element of user choice for which articles they see (beyond setting general categories of interest).

Additionally, there is a utility file used for extracting the URL's of my several hundred 'saved' pages that reads stumbleupon's internal map of site IDs to actual URL's, in case the site closes at some point and I no longer have access to this bank of saved pages.
