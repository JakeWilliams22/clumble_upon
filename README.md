# clumble_upon
Stumble Upon clone & utilities after closure of the site in June 2018.

Clumble Upon (clone + stumble-upon) creates a vastly simplified version of the old UI of stumbleupon, as a result of the site rebranding and redesigning itself as Mix.com.

The redesigned Mix.com is essentially a personalized reddit, and the biggest aspect of StumbleUpon that I enjoyed was the automatic, extremely varied articles that automatically were loaded for me - often leading to articles/resources/games I would not usually be interested in but ended up finding enjoyable or interesting. Having all possible matches available for me to see means that my own bias goes into what articles I read. This clone replicates the old behavior of stumbleupon and prevents this negative behavior.

Additionally, there is a utility file used for extracting the URL's of my several hundred 'saved' pages that reads stumbleupon's internal map of site IDs to actual URL's, in case the site closes at some point and I no longer have access to this bank of saved pages.
